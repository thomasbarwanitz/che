// Provides a lightweight implementation of jsonrpc2.0 protocol.
// The original jsonrpc2.0 specification - http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification
//
// The implementations does not fully implement the protocol
// and introduces a few modifications to its terminology in
// term of exec-agent transport needs.
//
// From the specification:
// The Client is defined as the origin of Request objects and the handler of Response objects.
// The Server is defined as the origin of Response objects and the handler of Request objects.
//
// Exec-agent serves as both, server and client as it receives
// Responses and sends Notifications in the same time.
//
// Request.
// It's a message from the physical websocket connection client to the exec-agent server.
// Request(in it's origin form) is considered to be unidirectional.
// WS Client =---> WS Server.
//
// Response.
// It's a message from the the exec-agent server to a websocket client,
// indicates the result of the operation execution requested by certain request.
// Response doesn't exist without request. The response is considered to be unidirectional.
// WS Client <---= WS Server
//
// Event.
// Is a message from the exec-agent server to a websocket client, the analogue
// from the specification is Notification, which is defined as a request
// which doesn't need any response, that's also true for events.
// Events may happen periodically and don't need to be indicated by request.
// WS Client <---X WS Server
